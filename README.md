## Pretending Tab - Images Viewer (This info for next update, soon)
A simple User Script that Opens the full size image in tab like view. Offering three view states. Fitting, filling, original, to the view.

Action | Trigger
---|---
**Activate** | left click, on links or hyperlinked images
**Deactivate** | right click
**Toggle view** | middle click, left click
**Force context menu** | long right click, right click + shift

Since it's just me using the script, obviously not many links are supported, but if someone is interested in the script, I can add support for few more websites
